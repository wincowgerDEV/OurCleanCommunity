# Welcome to Our Clean Community

## Background
Global scales of plastic pollution research have helped to aid in policy recommendations to state and global governments. With the aid of new microscale phone enabled technologies from Litterati and Marine Debris Tracker, we may begin to resolve our questions about anthropogenic litter and plastic pollution to local communities. 

This project will advance the objectives of up and coming applied scientists. Participants will lead their own local research project on anthropogenic litter guided by resources and expertise from Dr. Win Cowger. Participants will learn about field data collection, data management, GIS, and modeling and will have the opportunity to have their name on an academic paper. Participants will clean up a street block in their local community three times a week for a month, while collecting detailed information on the materials, items, and brands that make up the constituents of the trash. No previous experience in research is needed and there will be a lot of opportunity for learning. 

The primary objective of this research is to use science to make a difference in our local community. We will explore dynamics like overfilled trash cans, littering, infrequent street sweeping, illegal dumping, wind transport, and other questions that cannot be revealed at any other scales besides the micro. All data will be time stamped, photographed, and georeferenced creating a trustworthy dataset rich in evidence. Participants visibility in their community during this project may encourage other community members to join the project and make participants the de facto litter ambassador of their community. The conclusion of this research will be an academic paper or many with all dedicated and committed contributors listed as coauthors. This paper will be presented to the local government who we will also consult along the way. 

## Goals
1. Measure litter generation rates around the world. 
2. Assess why we see higher and lower litter generation rates in different places. 
3. Determine how litter arrives at the location we find it. 
4. Quantify the efficacy of litter prevention efforts. 

## Methodology
### Site Selection:

Determine a manageable location on your street to clean up and record data three times a week for a month. The site should be large enough to that you would find at least 100 piece of trash on your first survey but not so large that you would need to record more than 1000 piece on your first survey. An innitial visit to assess the amount of litter will be helpful for determining  Draw it on a map, and send it to Win via email at wincowger@gmail.com. It is important that you think you can feasibly clean up the entire area three times a week and that you can accurately find the boundaries in the real world that you drew on the map. Zoom in on the map to outline it very clearly and precisely. The site should encompass both sides of the road and not extend into private property. See the more specific instructions for greater details on how to create your site.

Download the app to phone.

### How to use the app:
Join the “Our Clean Community” group in the app. Take photos of every piece of trash you find, tag them with item, material, and brand identification, and press submit. Use the category cheat sheet to use as the item and material names. Add the brand if there is one or leave it blank. Open up receipts so that the entire receipt can be read from the image.


### Data Quality and Methodological  Checklist: 
1. Safety first, be aware of cars on the road and don’t go into the road if there are moving cars.
2. Any rule can be broken for the sake of safety or respect for your community just record rules that have to be broken on a particular day.
3. Take photos of every piece of trash within the area of interest on each sampling day.
4. Cover the area systematically, eg. by walking it abreast, in bands or otherwise subdividing it for complete coverage. Do not walk in the center of the road but if you see trash from the sidewalk and it is safe to grab the trash you may retrieve it.
5. Stay inside of the area of interest.
6. Take the photo as soon as you find the trash.
7. Take only one photo of each object.
8. Take the photo within 1 m of where the trash lays.
9. Have a ruler in the photo to scale the size of the items. 
10. It is best to take one photo of each object but it is sometimes necessary to take a photo of multiple objects at the same time in the case of one item being broken into many. If photographing multiple objects, place only similar things in an image together.
11. Photos should be close up but you should be able to see the entire item with enough background behind it to tell if it is against a fence, on the curb, in the street ect.
12. Any brands on the objects should be visible in the image.
13. If there is a pile of trash, deconstruct the pile and take photos of like objects together in one image or photograph each piece individually.
14. If there is a bag full of more than 10 items of trash just photograph the bagful. 
15. If there are items that cannot be removed because they are hazardous or too large, photograph them once on the day they are spotted and take note of them if they disappear or move. 
16. Photograph anything the size of a cigarette butt (approximately 1 cm) and larger.
17. Retake any photos that do not meet the quality expectations of this study including blurry photos or photos that do not have the entire object in view. 
18. Label the material, item, and brand of each object in the app. 
19. Use the trash terms sheet for materials and item identification and copy the name exactly, spaces and all. 
20. If there is a material or item not on the list you can create a new one and use that term each time.
21. If the object is many materials use the most abundant material in the mixture.
22. If there are many objects write them all.
23. The better your photos, the less time it will take to verify them later.
24. Take notes using the note sheet.

### Analyze your data:

You will need to go through and manually verify all of the data to remove any photos that don’t belong or reclassify images with any corrections and to tally all the items in multi item images. If the photos are tagged correctly the first time it will tremendously speed up this process. This will happen once at the middle and once at the end of your study. 

### Social Presence:

- Hashtag #OurCleanCommunity when posting to social media. 
- Invite others to join the group.

## Major Learnings
Publication pending, results of the first study will be released soon. 

## Highlighted Achievements
- Over 20 researchers have contributed to the project so far.
